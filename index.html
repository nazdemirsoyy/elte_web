                The Republic of Turkey, is a transcontinental country straddling
                Southeastern Europe and Western Asia. It is bordered on its
                northwest by Greece and Bulgaria; north by the Black Sea;
                northeast by Georgia; east by Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran;
                southeast by Iraq; south by Syria and the Mediterranean Sea; and
                west by the Aegean Sea. Istanbul, which straddles Europe and
                Asia, is the country's largest city, while Ankara is the
                capital. Approximately 70 to 80 percent of the country's
                citizens are ethnic Turks, while the largest minority are Kurds
                at 20 percent.

                The Anatolian peninsula, comprising most of modern Turkey, is
                one of the oldest permanently settled regions in the world.
                Various
                <b class="underline">ancient Anatolian</b> populations have
                lived in <b class="underline">Anatolia</b>, from at least the
                <b class="underline">Neolithic</b> until the
                <b class="underline">Hellenistic period</b>. Many of these
                peoples spoke the <b class="underline">Anatolian languages</b>,
                a branch of the larger
                <b class="underline">Indo-European language family</b>: and,
                given the antiquity of the Indo-European
                <b class="underline">Hittite</b> and
                <b class="underline">Luwian</b> languages, some scholars have
                proposed
                <b class="underline"
                  >Anatolia as the hypothetical centre from which the
                  Indo-European languages radiated</b
                >. The European part of Turkey, called
                <b class="underline">Eastern Thrace</b>, has also been inhabited
                since at least forty thousand years ago, and is known to have
                been in the Neolithic era by about 6000 BC.

              <section>
                The Turkish War of Independence (19 May 1919 – 24 July 1923)
                refers to several military campaigns waged by the
                <b class="underline">Turkish National Movement</b> against
                native Christian minorities and the Allied powers—namely,
                <b class="underline">Greece in the west</b>,
                <b class="underline">Armenia in the east</b>,<b>
                  France in the south</b
                >,
                <b class="underline"
                  >the royalists and the separatists in various cities</b
                >, and the
                <b class="underline"
                  >United Kingdom and Italy in Constantinople (now Istanbul)</b
                >—after parts of the Ottoman Empire were occupied and
                partitioned following the Ottomans' defeat in
                <b class="underline">World War I</b>. A phrase originating out
                of modern Turkish national historiography, the Turkish War of
                Independence began with
                <b class="underline">Mustafa Kemal Atatürk</b> and his
                colleagues forming a counter government (the Grand National
                Assembly) in Anatolia. After the end of the fighting on the
                Turkish–Armenian, Franco-Turkish and Greco-Turkish fronts (often
                referred to as the Eastern Front, the Southern Front, and the
                Western Front of the war, respectively), the Treaty of Sèvres
                was abandoned and the Treaties of Kars (October 1921) and
                Lausanne (July 1923) were signed. The Allies left Anatolia and
                Eastern Thrace, and the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (which
                remains Turkey's primary legislative body today) declared the
                Republic of Turkey on 29 October 1923. With the establishment of
                the Turkish National Movement, the partitioning of the Ottoman
                Empire, and the abolition of the sultanate, the Ottoman era and
                the Empire came to an end, and with Atatürk's reforms, the Turks
                created the modern, secular nation-state of Turkey. On 3 March
                1924, the Ottoman caliphate was officially abolished and the
                last Caliph was exiled.

                The official language is <b class="underline">Turkish</b>, which
                is the most widely spoken Turkic language in the world. It is
                spoken by 85.54 percent of the population as a first language.
                11.97 percent of the population speaks the Kurmanji dialect of

                Turkey is a secular state with no official state religion; the
                Turkish Constitution provides for freedom of religion and
                conscience. A 2016 survey by Ipsos, interviewing 17,180 adults
                across 22 countries, found that
                <b class="underline">Islam</b> was the dominant religion in
                Turkey, adhered to by 82% of the total population; religiously
                unaffiliated people comprised 13% of the population, while 2%

                Turkey is a transcontinental country

                  >bridging Southeastern Europe and Western Asia</b
                >. Asian Turkey, which includes 97 percent of the country's
                territory, is separated from European Turkey by the Bosphorus,
                the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles. European Turkey
                comprises only 3 percent of the country's territory. Turkey
                covers an area of 783,562 square kilometres (302,535 square
                miles), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 square
                miles) is in Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9,175 square
                miles) is in Europe. Turkey is the world's 37th-largest country
                by land area. The country is encircled by seas on three sides:
                the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the
                <b class="underline">Mediterranean Sea</b> to the south. Turkey
                also contains the <b class="underline">Sea of Marmara</b> in the
                northwest.
